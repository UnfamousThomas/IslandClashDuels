# IslandClashDuels

## Expalanations:
1. I was planning to TRY to use apache commons math 3 to make a Poisson distributsion, although I had no idea how but did not have enough time in the end.
2. In a real life situation obviously would also be more duel handling and better tracking stuff. Just a fast & quick solution. Also why this has no DB / YML stuff
3. I did make a **small** ELO system, but it simply adds one to your elo if opponent logs out.
4. I would usually use a system for registering commands without plugin.yml however due to the limited time I had, I used the normal system for it.

## I've also just now realized that using Queues instead of a list would have been a better solution...
