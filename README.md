# IslandClashDuels
A small project made as an interview project. Allows people to duel (matchmaking).
## Explanations:
1. I was planning to TRY to use apache commons math 3 to make a Poisson distributsion, abut did not have enough time in the end.
2. In a real life situation obviously would also be more duel handling and better tracking stuff. Just a fast & quick solution. Also why this has no DB / YML. I am pretty sure it also bugs out when you have 3 people run the duel command at the same time.
3. I did make a **small** ELO system, but it simply adds one to your elo if opponent logs out.
4. I would usually use a system for registering commands without plugin.yml however due to the limited time I had, I used the normal system for it.

Also, looking back at this project now (2023) a queue would have been better.
